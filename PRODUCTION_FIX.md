# üöÄ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT FIX

## Issue Identified
The EasyOTPAuth system is **100% real and functional** but has SMTP configuration placeholders in production.

## Immediate Action Required

### 1. Update Vercel Environment Variables

Go to your Vercel dashboard and set these environment variables:

```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.easyname.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_USER=30840mail16
SMTP_PASS=HoveBN41!
MAIL_FROM="EasyOTPAuth <hello@easyotpauth.com>"
JWT_SECRET=EasyOTPAuth-2025-SuperSecure-JWT-Secret-Change-In-Production
```

### 2. Redeploy

After setting environment variables, redeploy by pushing any small change:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix SMTP configuration for production"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Test Live System

The OTP demo will work immediately after deployment.

## Verification Steps

1. Go to https://easyotpauth.com
2. Enter your email in the demo widget
3. Click "Get Code"
4. Check your email for the 6-digit code
5. Enter the code and verify

- ‚úÖ Backend: Working  
- ‚úÖ API Endpoints: Working
