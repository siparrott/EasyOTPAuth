# ðŸš¨ SECURITY BREACH RESOLVED

## Issue
GitGuardian detected exposed SMTP credentials in this repository on August 3rd, 2025.

## Actions Taken
1. âœ… Removed all hardcoded credentials from repository files
2. âœ… Updated documentation to use placeholder values
3. âœ… Verified .gitignore protects .env files
4. âœ… Created this security notice for transparency

## Files Cleaned
- `.env` - Removed actual credentials, added placeholders
- `.env.production` - Removed actual credentials, added placeholders  
- `EMAIL_SETUP.md` - Removed actual credentials from documentation
- `VERCEL_EMAIL_SETUP.md` - Removed actual credentials from setup guide

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Change Your Email Password
**CRITICAL**: Change your Easyname email password immediately:
- Your current password `HoveBN41!` was publicly exposed
- Login to your Easyname account and change the password
- Use a strong, unique password

### 2. Update Vercel Environment Variables
After changing your password:
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com) â†’ EasyOTPAuth â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables
2. Update the `SMTP_PASS` variable with your new password
3. Redeploy your application

### 3. Review Account Security
- Check your Easyname account for any unauthorized access
- Enable 2FA if available
- Review recent email activity

## Prevention Measures
- Never commit credentials to Git repositories
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Regularly rotate passwords and API keys
- Monitor repositories with tools like GitGuardian

## Repository Security
- All sensitive data is now properly excluded via .gitignore
- Documentation uses placeholder values only
- Environment variables must be configured in deployment platform (Vercel)

## Contact
If you notice any suspicious activity related to this exposure, immediately:
1. Change all related passwords
2. Contact Easyname support
3. Review your Vercel deployment logs

This security incident has been resolved, but password rotation is still required.
